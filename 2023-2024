This data is for the LA Science Fair and hopefully for ISEF as well if we are able to qualify for this science Fair
This is taking place in the 2023-2024 season and we are trying to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Project Abstract:


TO DOS:
1.) Research more about data necessary for what we are doing currently with TGF Beta waves (look in RNNS and De Novo Drug Design)
2.) Try finishing the code by next week and also know the shape of the data that will be trained(and tell Vinayan)
3.) Finish the abstract today and start formulating ideas for the poster board (come up with statistics)
